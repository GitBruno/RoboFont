INDESIGN TAGGED TEXT
==========

Compare glyphs in all open fonts
-------------
This script is an extension of a script by Paul van der Laan.

It generates an InDesign Tagged Text file which compares glyphs from all open fonts.
A .txt file is generated in the working folder of the current font.
To use the .txt file, simply place it in an open InDesign document.
